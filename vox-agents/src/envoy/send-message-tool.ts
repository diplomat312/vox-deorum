/**
 * @module envoy/send-message-tool
 *
 * The live envoy's `send-message` tool (interactive-diplomacy refactor 05.1).
 *
 * Speaking to the counterpart is an explicit action, not raw assistant free text: the model
 * always picks a tool, so its action space is uniform and it stops narrating-instead-of-acting.
 * The `Message` argument is streamed back to the client exactly like free text used to be (see
 * `utils/models/send-message-stream.ts`), so a spoken reply still renders as a normal text bubble
 * rather than a tool-call card. A diplomat conversation archives each validated call here, after
 * its streamed argument is complete; terminal reconciliation later mirrors that durable row into
 * the thread cache.
