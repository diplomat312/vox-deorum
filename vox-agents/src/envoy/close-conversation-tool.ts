/**
 * @module envoy/close-conversation-tool
 *
 * The diplomat's `close-conversation` tool (interactive-diplomacy stage 2).
 *
 * Closing a conversation is recorded as a special `close` transcript message rather than a
 * status flag. vox-agents derives open/closed status — and the same-turn resume lock — from
 * the presence and turn of that message: once closed, the conversation cannot be reopened on
 * the same turn (specs §8).
 *
 * The tool itself writes nothing. It stages the close, authored by the diplomat's own seat
 * (endpoint B), on the active chat turn; that turn commits it through `closeConversation` once the
 * spoken reply and any nested negotiator work have settled, so the close row is always last.
