 * Guarded Lua reconciling the engine's autoplay state with the session config.
 * Civ V serializes the autoplay counter, the return player, and the pregame
 * slot statuses into saves, so a loaded (or taken-over) game may still be
 * auto-playing when the config wants a human at the helm, or idle when the
 * config wants autoplay. Idempotent: every arm is a no-op when the game
 * already matches the config, so it is safe on every GameSwitched and on
 * crash recovery.
 *
 * - `autoPlay: true`, game idle (a loaded human save): activate autoplay.
 * - `autoPlay: false`, game auto-playing: `SetAIAutoPlay(0, seat)` takes the
 *   `CvGame::setAIAutoPlay` deactivation path, which reseats `returnPlayerID`
 *   as the live human.
 * - `autoPlay: false`, counter expired naturally (counter 0 but the active
 *   player is still parked in the observer slot): re-arm the counter — the
 *   activation path returns early when the active slot is already an observer
 *   — then disarm with a return player to take the full
 *   deactivation path and reseat the human.
 *
 * Caveat: if the return seat's civ is dead in the loaded save,
 * `CvGame::setAIAutoPlay` returns control as an observer instead.
