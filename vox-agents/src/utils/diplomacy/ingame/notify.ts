/**
 * @module utils/diplomacy/notify
 *
 * The one place a durable conversation outcome becomes a native in-game notification
 * (interactive-diplomacy stage 7.04 work item 7).
 *
 * Decision 5 of the wiring plan is the whole of this module's policy: **reaching `done` is necessary
 * but not sufficient.** A turn that streamed, committed, and completed cleanly still says nothing to
 * the player unless it actually produced something new to read — a counterpart reply, a closure, or a
 * deal state transition. So the eligibility test is over the *durable rows the action created*, never
 * over "did the call succeed": an idempotent rejection acknowledgement, a validation error, a
 * proposal conflict, an unavailable turn, and a transport failure all deliver no notification, because
 * none of them wrote anything the player has not already been told about.
 *
 * Delivery itself is best-effort and deliberately swallows its own failures. By the time this runs the
 * conversation action has already committed to an append-only store; turning a failed notification
 * into the action's failure would tell the player their message was lost when it was not. A posting
 * failure is therefore logged and reported through the return value, never thrown.
