/**
 * @module envoy/ingame-bridge
 *
 * Makes the in-game diplomacy panel a second client of the Web conversation backend
 * (interactive-diplomacy stage 7.04 work items 5-7).
 *
 * The panel does not get its own chat engine. A `DiplomacyChatMessage` and a propose/counter
 * `DiplomacyDealAction` both run through the same `runChatTurn` the Web route runs, and accept/reject
 * run through the same shared `acceptDealAction` / `rejectDealAction` the Web routes run; the only
 * thing this module owns is the transport — two independent per-pair FIFOs, a game-shaped
 * `ChatStreamSink`, and the mapping from typed backend failures to `Status{error}`.
 *
 * The two queues are the load-bearing invariant. The **action FIFO** serializes the mutating work for
 * one pair (a turn holds the thread lock for as long as the model runs); the **push FIFO** orders the
 * Lua calls that reach the game. Sink callbacks fire from inside the model run and must never wait on
 * the action FIFO, so they only ever *append* to the push FIFO. An action observes its own pushes at
 * the end by snapshotting the push tail — legal only because the observer is a worker of the *other*
 * queue (see {@link enqueue}).
