/**
 * @module utils/diplomacy/deal-reduce
 *
 * Server-side reduction of a conversation's append-ordered deal messages into the latest
 * active proposal and its agreement status (interactive-diplomacy stage 5, work item 4).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for deal-state reduction; the stage-4 UI reducer
 * (`ui/src/components/deal/deal-reduce.ts`) is a thin typed wrapper that delegates here (via the
 * `@vox` alias), so the two can never drift. The in-game panel carries a small Lua port in
 * `civ5-mod/UI/VoxDeorumDiploPanel.lua`; keep its reducer semantics synchronized with this file.
 * The durable transcript is append-only and
 * status-free (specs §6), so the current deal state is *derived*, never stored. The diplomat (to
 * see the on-the-table deal), the negotiator loop (to forward it), and the orchestration layer
 * (to decide what to enact) all reduce here rather than guessing.
 *
 *  - `deal-proposal` / `deal-counter` replace the active deal (the latest on the table wins);
 *  - `deal-accept` / `deal-reject` / `deal-enacted` reference the proposal they answer via
 *    `Payload.ProposalMessageID`;
 *  - **agreement** exists only when the active proposal has the required acceptance from its
 *    recipient and no later counter/reject supersedes it; `deal-enacted` records that the deal was
 *    enacted in-game for that proposal (its trade items transferred and promise commitments applied).

 * transcript has its own resolved fate, and it keeps that fate after a newer proposal supersedes it.
 * Reading status off the active reduction instead made an accepted card silently revert to
 * "superseded" the moment the conversation moved on, which left its acceptance visible only in the
 * standalone outcome rows.
 *
 * Status rules are identical to `deriveActiveProposal`: `enacted` is terminal, and acceptance is
 * sticky against a later reject of the same proposal. Supersession is reported alongside the status
 * rather than replacing it, so callers can prefer a real outcome and fall back to "superseded" only
 * for a proposal that was never answered.
 *
 * This is display-only. Nothing in the accept/reject/enact write path should branch on it.
