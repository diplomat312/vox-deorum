/**
 * @module utils/diplomacy/deal-actions
 *
 * The transport-neutral answers to a standing offer: accept and reject/retract
 * (interactive-diplomacy stage 7.04 work item 1).
 *
 * These used to live inside the Express handlers in `web/chat/deal.ts`, tangled with request parsing
 * and status mapping. That was fine while the Web was the only client; it stopped being fine once the
 * in-game panel became a second one, because the interesting part is not the HTTP plumbing — it is
 * the diplomacy-thread guard, the live-turn/closed-this-turn gate, the per-thread lock, the
 * authoritative backend call, and the live-cache hydration. Forking that for the bridge would have
 * meant two subtly different definitions of "may this player accept this deal right now?".
 *
 * So the actions live here, take an already-opened `EnvoyThread`, and throw typed errors. Thread
 * *lookup* stays transport-specific: Express resolves a `chatId`, the in-game bridge opens the pair
 * with `openDiplomacyChat`. Each transport maps the same error types to its own vocabulary
 * (HTTP status classes for the Web, `Status{error}` for the game).
 *
 * This module deliberately lives under `utils/diplomacy` rather than under `web/`: the bridge must be
 * able to call it without importing Express.
