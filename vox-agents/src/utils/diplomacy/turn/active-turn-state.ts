/**
 * @module utils/diplomacy/active-turn-state
 *
 * The per-thread coordination state for one active chat turn (interactive-diplomacy stage 7.04,
 * technical decision 1).
 *
 * Streaming deltas are temporary presentation; the transcript is authoritative. A turn therefore has
 * to tell its client which durable rows it actually created — the caller row, the archived diplomat
 * reply, and any deal/close row the diplomat's own tools wrote mid-run. Rereading the transcript
 * afterwards is both a wasted round trip and a correctness hazard (it also picks up rows the turn did
 * NOT write). So instead every write-through helper reports the exact row the store just confirmed,
 * and the turn that owns the thread lock collects them.
 *
 * The same registration carries the two other facts a mid-run tool knows and terminal reconciliation
 * needs: which durable row the spoken reply landed on (so the retained native trace attaches by ID
 * rather than by scanning for a plausible row) and whether the diplomat asked to close (held back
 * until reconciliation so the close row commits after every other durable write). All three share one
 * key and one lifetime, which is why they are one record rather than three registries.
 *
 * `beginChatTurn` creates the registration right after it takes the thread lock and releases it in
 * `finish()`, so "a turn state is registered for this thread" means exactly "a chat turn is in
 * flight for it" — which is what {@link stageThreadClose}'s false result reports.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal:
 *  - **No `AsyncLocalStorage`.** The registry is keyed by thread id, and every relevant writer
 *    already receives the active `EnvoyThread`. That is the whole correlation key.
 *  - **No transcript cursor or follow-up query.** A row is recorded only after the backing store
 *    confirms the *current* operation created it.
 *  - **No transport argument threaded through the negotiator tools.** Every report — a durable row,
 *    the spoken row's identity, a close request — is a no-op when no turn is registered for that
 *    thread, so a blocking status write (or a bare tool call in a test) simply reports into the void.
 *  - **No state the turn could recompute.** Only facts a mid-run writer knows and the terminal path
 *    cannot rederive get held here.
 *
 * The per-thread chat lock (`chat-turn-commit.ts`) guarantees at most one turn per thread, so the
 * registry holds at most one record per thread id and a nested write can never land in a sibling
 * turn's capture.
