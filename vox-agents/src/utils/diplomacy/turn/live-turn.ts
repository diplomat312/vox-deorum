/**
 * @module utils/diplomacy/live-turn
 *
 * The single authority on "which turn is this conversation acting on, and may it act at all?"
 * (interactive-diplomacy stage 7.04 work item 1).
 *
 * Every conversation action — a streamed chat turn, a deal accept, a deal reject — needs the same two
 * answers before it writes anything: the live game turn, and whether the conversation was already
 * closed on it. Those checks used to exist twice, and the two copies disagreed: `runChatTurn` treated
 * a live thread with no current turn as *unavailable*, while the Express deal routes silently fell
 * back to `thread.metadata.turn` or turn zero, which turns "the game is not running" into "turn 0,
 * definitely not closed". This module keeps the stricter behaviour and deletes the fallback.
 *
 * Both failure modes get their own error type, so the Web mapper and the in-game bridge classify them
 * by `instanceof` rather than by inspecting message text.
