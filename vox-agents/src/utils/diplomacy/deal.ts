/**
 * @module utils/diplomacy/deal
 *
 * Deal-action I/O between the conversation clients (the Web deal screen from interactive-diplomacy
 * stage 4, and the in-game panel from stage 7) and the mcp-server: read-only `inspect-deal`
 * inspection plus the typed deal-action transcript writes.
 *
 * The writers split by who owns the decision:
 *  - `deal-proposal` / `deal-counter` are archival `append-message` writes (specs §6): the row is
 *    archived, nothing streams, notifies, runs agents, or enacts. They are a single "submit a deal"
 *    action that commits as the turn's commit point through the unified streaming
 *    `/api/agents/message` path (so the diplomat's reply streams after); `appendDealProposal` is the
 *    shared chokepoint both that path and the negotiator's tool use, and `classifyDealSubmission`
 *    reconciles the submission against the live offer state under the turn lock;
 *  - `deal-reject` goes through the transactional `reject-agent-deal` action (stage 7.04), which owns
 *    rejection idempotency and staleness in one serialized store transaction;
 *  - `deal-accept` / `deal-enacted` go through the enactment route (`enact-agent-deal`, stage 6),
 *    their only writer (pinned contract).
 *
 * `append-message` refuses all three of the outcome types, so no caller can bypass the transactional
 * actions. Both of those actions hand back the exact durable rows they committed, so a caller
 * hydrates its live cache — and the panel its transcript — without ever rereading the transcript.
 *
 * The per-item value snapshots stored on a proposal (`Payload.Value1` / `Payload.Value2`)
 * are computed here from a fresh `inspect-deal` before archival, so the stored snapshot
 * reflects the live `GetTradeItemValue` of each item to each ordered player. The trade
 * screen's other-side total balance is summed from these on the client — never stored as a
 * precomputed total (specs §3, deal-schema PerItemValueMap).

 * superseding an offer that opened under it, AND a stale counter from reviving a dead negotiation. There
 * is no author check (unlike `requireCurrentOpenProposal`): revising your own standing offer is allowed.
