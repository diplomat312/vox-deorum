/**
 * Shared mechanics for the two transactional deal-outcome routes, `enact-agent-deal` (which owns
 * `deal-accept` + `deal-enacted`) and `reject-agent-deal` (which owns `deal-reject`).
 *
 * Both tools run the same shape inside one `store.runWriteTransaction`: load a proposal by ID,
 * confirm it really is a proposal, read its pair's whole ordered transcript, scan that transcript
 * for rows answering the proposal, then stamp and insert one or more outcome rows. Keeping those
 * steps here means the two routes cannot drift in how they read the conversation or in the shape of
 * the durable rows they hand back — a drift that would be invisible until a caller's transcript
 * cache disagreed with the store.
 *
 * What deliberately does NOT live here is *classification*. The two routes read the same states and
 * reach different verdicts on purpose: a wrong accepter matters only to enactment, an existing
 * rejection by the other endpoint only to rejection, and a missing proposal is a thrown error for
 * one and a structured conflict for the other. So every function below reports what it found and
 * lets the caller decide what that means.
