/**
 * Tool for appending a single message to a durable diplomatic conversation.
 *
 * There is exactly one conversation per ordered pair of players, so this tool needs
 * no thread identity. It takes endpoint-oriented input ({ PlayerAID, PlayerBID, ... })
 * and orders the two IDs server-side (Player1ID = min, Player2ID = max), remapping the
 * per-endpoint roles to match. Roles are free-form EnvoyThread-style descriptors
 * (agent name for an LLM side, UserIdentity.role for a human side, `observer` for the
 * observer endpoint). The observer sentinel (-1) is accepted as a special case: it
 * sorts to Player1ID, defaults its role to `observer`, and is exempt from the
 * living-major check (the other endpoint must still be a living major when game state
 * is available). Roles do not encode human-vs-LLM.
 *
 * The tool is archival only: it does not stream, notify, run agents, enact deals, or
 * decide whether a deal is current/accepted. A pure observer's real seat is accepted the
 * same way, under the exact `Observer` role: it is a concrete slot that holds no
 * civilization, so it is exempt from the living-major check and owns no visibility column,
 * but it must be paired with one in-range major civilization. It writes one TimedKnowledge
 * row and sets visibility for the real participant(s). None of the three terminal deal answers is
 * emitted here (a pinned writer-split): `deal-accept` and `deal-enacted` go through the
 * enactment route (enact-agent-deal, stage 6) and `deal-reject` through the rejection
 * route (reject-agent-deal, stage 7.04). Each of those routes runs its own validation and
 * idempotency check inside one serialized store transaction, so proposal state is decided
 * transactionally instead of by a caller's racy read-then-write; both write their records
 * via the same store path. This tool therefore only ever writes non-terminal messages:
 * `text`, `close`, `deal-proposal`, and `deal-counter`.
