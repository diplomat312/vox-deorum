/**
 * Tool that transactionally rejects (or retracts) an open agent deal proposal.
 *
 * This is the rejection route: the sole writer of the `deal-reject` transcript record (the
 * public `append-message` tool refuses it, a pinned writer-split alongside `deal-accept` /
 * `deal-enacted`). It sits beside `enact-agent-deal` so BOTH terminal answers to a proposal
 * are decided by one serialized read/check/write against the store rather than by a caller's
 * racy read-then-write: two clients racing to reject the same proposal, or racing a rejection
 * against an acceptance, can no longer both win.
 *
 * Either endpoint may speak the rejection: the counterparty *declines* the offer, or the
 * original proposer *retracts* their own offer (there is no separate `deal-retract` type).
 *
 * Idempotency: the proposal's existing `deal-reject` is the idempotency key. The same speaker
 * repeating their own rejection gets that stored row back with `AlreadyRejected: true` and no
 * second row is ever appended — a proposal carries at most ONE terminal rejection.
 *
 * Failure split: a lost race over proposal state (already rejected by the other endpoint,
 * already answered by an acceptance/enactment, superseded by a newer proposal, or a proposal
 * that never existed / is not a proposal at all) is a structured `conflict` result, so the
 * caller can map it to a 409-class outcome without parsing message text. A caller *bug*
 * (wrong conversation pair, speaker who is not an endpoint) and any infrastructure/DB failure
 * still throw through the MCP error channel.
