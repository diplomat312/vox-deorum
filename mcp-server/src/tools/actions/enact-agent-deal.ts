/**
 * Tool that enacts an agreed agent deal for real (interactive-diplomacy stage 6).
 *
 * This is the enactment route: the sole writer of the `deal-accept` and `deal-enacted`
 * transcript records (the public `append-message` tool refuses both, a pinned writer-split).
 * It takes a proposal message ID (and, optionally, the complete deal object), reduces the
 * conversation to enforce single-enactment, enacts the deal in-game, then records the agreement.
 *
 * **In-game enactment.** Between the idempotency check and the transcript writes it calls the DLL
 * enact path (`enactDeal` -> `inspect-deal.lua` enact mode -> `Deal:Enact` + `Player:SetPromise`),
 * which, in one atomic Lua invocation, validates every trade item and promise, then transfers the
 * items and applies the promises, bypassing the AI's political refusal while honoring structural
 * legality. A bridge error or an un-enacted result throws and writes nothing (so a `deal-enacted`
 * record never outlives a no-op enactment). On success it appends `deal-accept` (agreement reached)
 * and `deal-enacted` (enactment recorded) against the proposal.
 *
 * Idempotency: the `deal-enacted` record is the idempotency key. A second enactment of a
 * proposal that already has a `deal-enacted` is refused (returns the prior record, `Enacted: false`,
 * since this call did not enact it).
 *
 * **Failure split (stage 7.04).** Losing a race over proposal state — the proposal was superseded
 * by a newer one, was answered by a closing response, or the caller is not its recipient — is a
 * structured `Conflict` result rather than a thrown error, so a caller can distinguish a lost race
 * (409-class) from an infrastructure failure (502-class) without parsing message text. Everything
 * else still throws through the MCP error channel: a proposal that does not exist or is not a
 * proposal type, an invalid stored `Payload.Deal`, caller-supplied terms that do not match the
 * stored ones, an unavailable bridge, and a refused enactment.
 *
 * It also returns the full `AcceptRow` / `EnactedRow` projections of the records it wrote (and, on
 * the idempotent path, of the existing enactment record), so a caller can hydrate its live
 * transcript cache from the exact durable rows without rereading the transcript.
